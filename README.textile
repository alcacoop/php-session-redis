h1. php-session-redis

p. This small script implements a quick and dirty "Redis":http://redis.io backend for your php session. 

p. Essentially, it does nothing more than https://github.com/ivanstojic/redis-session-php, just something less, because for the sake of easiness we store only the base64 encoded session string.

p. So why to implement this backend? In redis-session-php, "ivanstojic":https://github.com/ivanstojic used "Predis":https://github.com/nrk/predis as the client library for handling the connection to Redis and that impose to have php version 5.3 or higher. "Rediska":http://rediska.geometria-lab.net seems to have more relaxed requirements for php version and so that's the story!

h2. Usage

p. Install _Rediska_ and set the correct include in _redis_session.php_ then you just have to require(\_once) this file at the very beginning of your pages, then call "session\_start()" when you need.

<pre>
<?php
require_once('redis_session.php');

// ...

session_start();

$_SESSION['test'] = 1;

...
</pre>
